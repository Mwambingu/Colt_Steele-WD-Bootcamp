## Overview

Created a TV Search Movie app as a final project on Callbacks, Promises, API & AJAX topic from Colt's Steele. The aim of this project was to test myself to see if I can be able to implement what I had learnt without Colt's solutions or code along. Pulling data from [TVMaze's API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api) to create a TV Search app. To accomplish this, I decided to focus on some familiar and unfamiliar technologies like the CSS framework Bulma, vanilla JS using both Fetch and Axios. It was a challenging but very fulfilling project.

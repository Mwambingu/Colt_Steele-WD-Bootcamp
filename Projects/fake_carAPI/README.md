## Overview

Created a fake car API using REST. The focus for this task I was focusing specifically on using Node, Express, EJS and Bootstrap. To create a fully functional API or mockup of an API. I used fake car data by storing the objects in an Array. REST made it easier to create all routes to facilitate all CRUD elements of the API. Learned a lot on handling routing using Express and templating via EJS. It was a real challenge but helped me solidify some of the learnt concepts.
